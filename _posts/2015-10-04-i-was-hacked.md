title: I was hacked
---

Today, thanks to a very good friend of mine, I discovered my email account
(yahoo) was hacked. I was shocked at the beginning, cause I was never hacked
before in my life, and the funny thing is that it happened now that I'm way more
paranoid than years ago. Without sharing too many details, here some lessons
re-learned: 

- Always be as paranoid as you can as there is no such thing as security. 

- Enable 2steps auth everywhere you can

- Change your password regularly

- Be ready to get hacked: secure your important data and don't have anything
  serious in your inbox.

Right now, I think they took only my address book. I don't have any evidence of
other actions, but I will be watching closely.
Please ignore any evident SPAM email I might have sent. The internet is a
dangerous place.
