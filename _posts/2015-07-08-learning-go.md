title: Learning Go
---

I spent my last week of work trying to learn Go. Till now, the experience is
very strange: I mostly like the language so far, but there are many things that
are surprising and different from other languages like empty interfaces, the
whole idea of the error handling without exceptions, no classes, etc. 
While I try to have an serious idea about Go, and I need some more days of
development, I collect here a collection of link that I found useful. 

[Go Slices: usage and
internals](http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals)

[Controlling array growth in
Golang](http://openmymind.net/Controlling-Array-Growth-In-Golang/)

[How to use interfaces in
Go](http://jordanorelli.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go)

[Ten useful techniques in Go](http://arslan.io/ten-useful-techniques-in-go)


Also, a very intersting book to start with [Go
bootcamp](http://www.golangbootcamp.com/)

I'll hopefully post more links in the next days, stay tuned.
