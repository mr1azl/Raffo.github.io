title: Why I Like Go
---

Go is an extremely popular language these days and many articles are popping
here and there about the details of the language, why it is cool or why it
sucks. Since a few years developers are debating about the use of interfaces, 
the lack of generics and so on. Go is now living its best moment due to a
wide adoption from projects like [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/).
The reason I like Go, though, is not because it is popular, not because of
goroutines or because of its huge adoption: it's because it is very easy to
read. I spent too much time in my career as a developer reading crappy or extremely complex code and each time I open a Go project, I
find it so natural I can read it almost like a book. There are obviously other
reasons, but simplicity and readability are the killer "features" of the
language for me.
