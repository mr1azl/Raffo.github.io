title: Football, Cars and Europe
---

What do football and cars have to do with Europe? Simply put: they play exactly
the same role in European countries. People spend a significant amount of time
being fan of a club, going to stadiums and getting involved in long discussion
on why their club is better than the others and why the other clubs suck so
much. I saw the same happening for cars today as the [Volkswagen scandal](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/20/vw-software-scandal-chief-apologises-for-breaking-public-trust) got public. 
It's really impressive to see Europeans go against each other for clubs as for cars. When this happens, you easily understand that Europe is not made yet. 
We are just a continent, a set of country together for economic reasons and not
because we belong together. Europe has a long way to go.
